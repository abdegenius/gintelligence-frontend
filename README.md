# Routify and Tailwind

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

Setting-up Tailwind CSS to a new [Svelte Routify](https://routify.dev/) project is a bit time consuming and maybe a little confusing. I created a version of [Routify starter](https://github.com/roxiness/routify-starter) that supports Tailwind. You can copy this blank project for a new project.
